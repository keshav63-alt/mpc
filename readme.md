MPC Interview AI System
A modular, voice-based interview platform leveraging Model Predictive Control (MPC) for adaptive time allocation. This solution enables highly dynamic, efficient, and fair interview sessions powered by advanced Python, AI, and speech technologies.





ðŸš€ Features
MPC-Based Question Timing: Optimal, adaptive allocation of time per question using Model Predictive Control techniques.

Voice-Driven Interviews: Seamless integration with Groq/OpenAI for real-time Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech.

Session & Inactivity Management: Session timers, automatic question skip after user inactivity, and complete session summaries.

Extensible Architecture: Clean modular files â€” easily customize, extend, or integrate with other AI services.
